            <p>A help system (sometimes called a help file ) is a documentation component of a software program that explains
                the features of the program and helps the user understand its capabilities. A bit like an extensive, organized,
                and thorough collection of FAQ s (frequently asked questions), the help system's purpose is to provide the answers
                that a user needs to understand to use the program effectively.
